# Security Policy

This is a basic format for a security file recommended by GitHub.
I am unsure what security issues we may have, as it's not like we are making this code from scratch. 
We are just trying to make the current code work, at least this is my understanding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This section explains how to report a vulnerability.
WHAT TO DO FOR THIS? --

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
